# SixPieces

SixPieces is based on [`babylon.js`](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and uses [this starter package](https://github.com/leon/starter-babylonjs) for the basic config.

# Getting started
Installation requires `npm`, the Node.js package manager. To run do
```
npm install
npm start
```
If the installation (first step) is succesful, the second step will open a web browser and the `localhost:3000`.
Both take some time.

Note that npm7 takes offense with some dependencies. npm6 doesn't.

# Setting up a server (not yet working)
```
npm install --save esm
npm run serve
```
